<p>We're a friendly bunch, so if there's something you'd like to
	bring to our attention, or discuss with us, we're ready to listen.
	There's also quite a few of us, so we set up this page to point you to
	the right person. Just follow this handy guide:</p>

<ol>
	<li>If you have a technical question don't resist the temptation
		to contact us directly: <a href="mailto:javaworkspace@gmail.com">javaworkspace@gmail.com</a>
	</li>

	<li>If you have a question about a particular tutorial regarding
		content, code or anything else, feel free to contact us.</li>

	<li>If you have a question or suggestion about JavaWorkspace in
		general, the best place to bring it up is <a
		href="mailto:javaworkspace@gmail.com">javaworkspace@gmail.com</a>.
	</li>

	<li>If you think we are doing a great job, a kind word in the
		JavaWorkspace Tutorials now and then really helps! If you think we are
		doing a super-duper-fantastic job, and you'd like to part with some
		money to help pay for hosting costs, that's what the <a
		href="http://www.javaworkspace.com/donations.do">donation page</a> is
		for. You might even get a fancy title out of it.
	</li>

	<li>If you're interested in running banner ads in some tutorials,
		or have some other deal to propose, contact us at <a
		href="mailto:javaworkspace@gmail.com">javaworkspace@gmail.com</a>.
