	<h2>Java Code Conventions</h2>
	<p>This Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language document
		contains the standard conventions that Sun follow and recommend that
		others follow. It covers filenames, file organization, indentation,
		comments, declarations, statements, white space, naming conventions,
		programming practices and includes a code example. Why have code
		conventions? Code conventions are important to programmers for a
		number of reasons:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to
			maintenance.</li>
		<li>Hardly any software is maintained for its whole life by the
			original author.</li>
		<li>Code conventions improve the readability of the software,
			allowing engineers to understand new code more quickly and
			thoroughly.</li>
		<li>If you ship your source code as a product, you need to make
			sure it is a well packaged and clean as any other product you create.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language document
		was revised and updated on April 20, 1999.</p>

		<strong>Why is documentation in code important?</strong>
	</p>
	<p>How many times have we gone over a piece of code wondering what
		it is trying to do? Most programs are not write-once. They are
		reworked and rewritten again and again in their lives. Bugs must be
		debugged. Changing requirements and the need for increased
		functionality mean the program itself may be modified on an ongoing
		basis. During this process, human beings must be able to read and
		understand the original code; it is therefore more important by far
		for humans to be able to understand the program than it is for the
		computer.</p>
