<h3>How to host a web site</h3>
<p>The purpose of this article is to describe how to host a web site
on your own MS Windows computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leveraging your own
hardware is a cheap way to set up a web site particularly when using off
the shelf, free software available on the internet. <br />
It is not particularly difficult to set up a web host once you know what
software to use and how to configure it.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is not
always easy to know where to start when you haven't done it before. <br />
I am assuming that you have some form of permanently connected broadband
access and that your broadband router/modem is able to pass through
traffic on port 80 (the default web server port).&nbsp; I am also
assuming that you have a registered domain name that points to your IP
address and have generated some basic web content for your website.<br />
This website is hosted on an old laptop of mine, now considered
reasonably under powered.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a Pentium III, 933 MHz, with
256MB RAM, and 20 GB HD.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This computer gives perfectly
acceptable performance for web hosting and for running additional
services such as databases and scripting languages.</p>
<h3>Choosing the Operating System for your web host</h3>
<p>There are many other websites that describe how to set up a web
host on Linux, however very few describe how to set up on
Windows.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
I would recommend using Windows XP Pro, Windows 2k or Windows
NT.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not recommend Windows 9x, ME or XP
Home.&nbsp;&nbsp; These tend to be less robust and their security
features are limited.<br />
Whatever OS you choose to use, always ensure that you have the latest
Service Packs from Microsoft.<br />
Please note:&nbsp; on newer versions of WinXP a firewall is
included.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please ensure that this has port 80 opened to
allow it to talk to your web server.</p>
