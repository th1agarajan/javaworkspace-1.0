<p>Do you recognize any of these icons? I am sure that like most
people you have been seeing more and more of them and others on various
sites and blogs. Click on any one of the icons and it will open a window
where you can save the details of this page to that social bookmarking
service.<br />
So what is Social Bookmarking and why is it so important today in
promoting our businesses, our web sites and our blogs? In this and the
following pages I will be exploring the answer to that question and
outlining some strategies for managing the ever increasing number of
social bookmark sites. <br />
If you want to better understand how social bookmarking works - read on
</p>
<h4>What is Social Bookmarking?</h4>
<p>Social Bookmarking refers to web based applications that enable
us to store bookmarks online instead of in our favorites or bookmarks on
our computers. The immediate advantage of this is that we can access our
bookmarked sites from any computer - even a mobile phone.<br />
However bookmarks also have a distinct advantage over search engine
results. Searching the internet with a search engine, no matter how
good, means that the information is selected by computer software that
attempts to determine meaning. <br />
A list of bookmarks is the result of human action, we filter the sites
we view and list links only to those sites that provide value. So if you
share some of my interests you will probably find it of value to access
my bookmarks list rather than using a search engine. Social bookmark
sites enable you make any link public or private so that we can make a
selection of our bookmarks available to each other. <br />
In order to sort and filter bookmarks on a social bookmarking site they
are <em>grouped</em> under broad subjects or are coded using <em>Tags</em>
- words or phrases which help us to find the link later and other sites
we have bookmarked that have the same tag.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with Social Bookmarking but want to know how
to use it as a powerful marketing strategy for driving traffic to your
web site: <br />
There are lots of social book marking services available in the market.
You can choose any one (or many) of your own and add it in your website,
Blogger, Wordpress and MySpace. Here we are going to discuss about</p>

<p>AddThis is the #1 bookmarking and sharing button on the Internet.
They help website publishers and bloggers spread their content across
the web by making it easy for visitors to bookmark and share content to
their favorite social destinations. AddThis is fast, powerful and easy
to install. Even better, it's free and offers sophisticated analytics to
help users understand how and where their content is being shared.
Launched in 2006, AddThis has grown dramatically and is currently viewed
over <strong>20 billion times a month</strong> by users all over the
world in over 20 languages.<br />
AddThis can be used to share just about anything, including:</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>Websites</li>
	<li>Blogs (Blogger, WordPress, TypePad, Tumblr)</li>
	<li>Email newsletters</li>
	<li>MySpace profiles</li>
	<li>Microsoft Office Live workspaces</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.addthis.com/help/embedded-content">Embedded

<img

The main advantage of using Add This bookmarking service is "No need to
add separate badge for each and every bookmarking service". By moving
mouse over the AddThis button you can bookmark in almost all the
bookmarking service. You can even customize the buttons. By registering
with AddThis you can even get the reports mailed to your email id.</p>

<p>AddThis Toolbox is quite similar to AddThisButton the only
difference is it allows you to display individual sharing services
instead of one button? The <strong>AddThis Toolbox</strong> provides
publishers more control over the display of sharing services on their
site.</p>
