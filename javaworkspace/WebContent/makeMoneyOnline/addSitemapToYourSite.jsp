<h1>Add Sitemap To Your Site</h1>

<p>What are Sitemaps? Sitemaps are an easy way for webmasters to
inform search engines about pages on their sites that are available for
crawling. In its simplest form, a Sitemap is an XML file that lists URLs
for a site along with additional metadata about each URL (when it was
last updated, how often it usually changes, and how important it is,
relative to other URLs in the site) so that search engines can more
intelligently crawl the site. Web crawlers usually discover pages from
links within the site and from other sites. Sitemaps supplement this
data to allow crawlers that support Sitemaps to pick up all URLs in the
Sitemap and learn about those URLs using the associated metadata. Using
the Sitemap protocol does not guarantee that web pages are included in
search engines, but provides hints for web crawlers to do a better job
of crawling your site. Sitemap 0.90 is offered under the terms of the
Attribution-ShareAlike Creative Commons License and has wide adoption,
including support from Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft.</p>
