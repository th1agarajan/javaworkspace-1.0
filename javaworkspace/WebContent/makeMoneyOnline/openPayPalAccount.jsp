<strong>You always need a PayPal account to make business
online. The money you get from Advertisers will be deposited in your
PayPal account or wired transfer or checks. You can get the money
transferred easily when you have PayPal account. So let's start with the
introduction of PayPal account and how to open PayPal account.</strong><br />
<br />

<strong><u>Introduction about PayPal</u></strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PayPal</strong> is an e-commerce business allowing
payments and money transfers to be made through the Internet. PayPal
serves as an electronic alternative to traditional paper methods such as
checks and money orders.</p>
<p>A PayPal account can be funded with an electronic debit from a
bank account or by a credit card. The recipient of a PayPal transfer can
either request a check from PayPal, establish their own PayPal deposit
account or request a transfer to their bank account. PayPal is an
example of a payment intermediary service that facilitates worldwide
e-commerce.<br />
PayPal performs payment processing for online vendors, auction sites,
and other commercial users, for which it charges a fee. It sometimes
also charges a transaction fee for receiving money (a percentage of the
amount sent plus an additional fixed amount). The fees charged depend on
the currency used, the payment option used, the country of the sender,
the country of the recipient, the amount sent and the recipient's
account type. In addition, eBay purchases made by credit card through
PayPal may incur a &quot;foreign transaction fee&quot; if the seller is
located in another country, as credit card issuers are automatically
informed of the seller's country of origin.</p>
<p>On October 3, 2002, PayPal became a wholly owned subsidiary of
eBay. Its corporate headquarters are in San Jose, California, United
States at eBay's North First Street satellite office campus. The company
also has significant operations in Omaha, Nebraska; Scottsdale, Arizona;
and Austin, Texas in the U.S.; India; Dublin; Berlin, and Tel-Aviv. As
of July 2007, across Europe, PayPal also operates as a Luxembourg-based
bank.</p>
