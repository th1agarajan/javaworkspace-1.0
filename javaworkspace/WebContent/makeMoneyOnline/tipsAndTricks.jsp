<h1>1. Blend your ads. Adsense color and font size</h1>
<p><strong>1.i</strong> It's tested and it works. Use the same
colour of your page background, for the border and the background of the
ad.<br />
<strong>1.ii</strong> Use the same colors used in your page, for the
Adsense ad title, text and url link.<br />
<strong>1.iiia</strong> If possible use the same font in your page, as
the Adsense ads. Since the ads have variable text size and font,
according to dimension and type of ad, you can never do this 100% right.
But every little bit helps.</p>
<h3>Real life Adsense font size and type</h3>
<p><strong>768×60 Ad unit:</strong><br />
<em>Title:</em> style=&quot;line-height:12px; font-size:11px;
font-family:verdana,arial,sans-serif&quot;<br />
<em>Description:</em> style=&quot;line-height:12px; font-size:10px;
font-family:verdana,arial,sans-serif&quot;<br />
<em>URL:</em> style=&quot;line-height:12px; font-size:10px&quot;
face=&quot;verdana,arial,sans-serif&quot;<br />
<strong>300×250 Ad unit:</strong><br />
<em>Title:</em> style=&quot;line-height:14px;font-size:11px&quot;
face=&quot;arial,sans-serif&quot;<br />
<em>Description:</em> style=&quot;line-height:14px;font-size:11px&quot;
face=&quot;arial,sans-serif&quot;<br />
<em>URL:</em> style=&quot;line-height:14px;font-size:10px&quot;
face=&quot;arial,sans-serif&quot;<br />
As you can notice above, some ads have the arial font as default, some
have verdana. Some have a 10px description text, some have 11px. And
besides all that, each box may contain 1 up to 4 ads, and depending on
that the font sizes will change. So it's really up to you to experiment
and see what works best for you, in as many cases as possible.<br />
<strong>1.iv</strong> Try to not separate the ad from the content (like
trashing the ad in some remote corner of your website. Integrate it
within the content (in, within, next to, above, below etc).</p>
<h1>2. Placing ads high on a page is good</h1>
<p>Position the ads with the highest CTR, as high as possible in the
page, in the source's order (in the image below, notice that the ad
appears just below the body tag). The first ads that appear in the pages
(in the source's order) get the most income per click.</p>
<h1>3. Use images. Images and Adsense work together</h1>
<p>Use images left or right of the ads. It makes them seen as part
of the pages content, and your CTR increases. It doesn't matter what
images you use. Use any plain generic images. If you can, try to
corelate those with the niche/domain of your website/blog. Be carefull
not to write text, point arrows or similar on the images, as that might
be seen as click incentives.</p>
<h1>4. Earnings are variable, based on CTR</h1>
<p>With the Smart pricing ideea, your income varies a lot, according
to each of your channel's CTR rate.<br />
<em>Now this is very important:</em> It's account-wide, not
channel-wide. So if you have a very good CTR (5%-50%) for one website,
and you include it in the same account with a 0.04# CTR website, you
will loose money.<br />
Remove all the websites (from your account) that don't have at least a
5% CTR (or depeding on your overall CTR, remove the ones that are really
lower than your average), or you'll affect the income of all the other
good converting websites.</p>
<h1>5. Use non-standard types of ads</h1>
<p>We all know that web-savvy (eg. webmasters or people that use the
Internet for so many years, and know all the standards, convetions and
so on) users are ad-blind. <br />
Banners like 468×80 have been on the Internet since it's creation. Even
people who use the Internet vaguely or once a month, are kind of blind
to these standard banners.<br />
Instead, use vertical skyscrapers, or boxed ads. They have a much higher
click rate. The Adsense team even published a list of their highest
performing ad sizes:</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>336×280 large rectangle</li>
	<li>300×250 inline rectangle</li>
	<li>160×600 wide skyscraper</li>
</ul>
