<h1>Privacy Policy Generator</h1>
<p>As Google have changed the Terms and Conditions of their Adsense
program, one of the requirements now is that all Adsense publishers
should have a &quot;Privacy Policy&quot; on their websites. Below is the
exact wording that has been added to the Terms and Conditions for
Adsense publishers....<br />
<strong><em><br />
&quot;You must have and abide by an appropriate privacy policy that
clearly discloses that third parties may be placing and reading cookies
on your user's browser, or using web beacons to collect information, in
the course of ads being served on your website. Your privacy policy
should also include information about user options for cookie
management.&quot;</em></strong><br />
<br />
Serprank have now updated the Google Adsense Privacy Policy Generator to
include a mention about the <em><strong>DoubleClick DART
cookie</strong></em>, which is now required by Google to be included in your privacy
policy. You can read more about the DoubleClick DART Cookie on the
following link...</p>
