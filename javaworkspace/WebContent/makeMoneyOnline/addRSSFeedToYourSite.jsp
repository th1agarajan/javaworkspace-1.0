<h1>Add RSS Feed To Your WebSite</h1>

<p>Considering how popular RSS feeds have become (primarily among
blogs, but also elsewhere), I find it annoying when I come across
websites that offer constantly updated content in a "feed-friendly"
format, but neglect to offer this option.<br />
Other times, I just want a more refined feed of one category of a blog.
Some blogs offer multiple RSS feeds for each category, but many do not.<br />
This is why I have compiled a list of online web services which allow
anyone to create an RSS feed of any website. Some are very simple while
others are more advanced, so depending on your level of expertise, you
are sure to find a tool that can help you get the custom RSS feed you
are seeking.</p>

<p><strong>1. <a target="_blank"
	href="http://www.feed43.com/">Feed43</a></strong> - My personal favorite, Feed43
is definitely not for the faint of heart. With this service I had the
most control over the final appearance of the feed, but I also had to
take a look at the <a target="_blank"
	href="http://www.feed43.com/tutorial.html">tutorial</a> to get an
understanding of how the syntax works to create variables. If that last
statement was too much for you, then this service probably is too. At
least I got a <a href="http://feed43.com/mgarrett.xml" target="_blank">well-configured
feed</a> from my <a href="http://profy.com/profile/mgarrett/articles/"
	target="_blank">Profy articles page</a> (which is feedless). Others
have used Feed43 to create <a href="http://5thirtyone.com/archives/174"
	target="_blank">RSS feeds of MySpace comments</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2. <a href="http://www.feedity.com/
	target="_blank">Feedity</a></strong> - This service is simple, but adds a small level
of refining to the automatically generated feeds. After users provide
the URL of the page to make a feed of, Feedity gives the option of
inputting a Start and End block (HTML tags), to notify the service where
each post starts and ends. This service was formerly known as <a
	href="http://mashable.com/2006/01/25/feedtier-create-rss-feeds-from-any-webpage/"
	target="_blank">FeedTier</a>.<br />

<p><strong>3. <a target="_blank"
	href="http://www.feedmarklet.com/">Feedmarklet</a></strong> - This tool is
probably the simplest and the easiest to use, but it requires manual
updating of the feed that you generate. Feedmarklet gives you your own
RSS feed instantly, with no sign up required. Using a bookmarklet button
in the browser bookmark bar, users can easily add any page to the feed
quickly. Not too many features are present here.</p>

<p><strong>4. <a target="_blank" href="http://dapper.net/">Dapper</a></strong>
- Dapper allows anyone to create Dapps (widgets) that track the content
of any website. This can also be used to track the RSS feeds of sites
that do not offer one. In terms of features, Dapper has the most diverse
selection, but it does require a learning curve. Be sure to check out <a
	target="_blank" href="http://www.dappit.com/dapperfox/">DapperFox</a>
which is a Firefox extension that creates an RSS feed from any page.</p>

<p><strong>5. <a target="_blank"
	href="http://www.feedyes.com/">FeedYes</a></strong> - Yet another of the easy
feed creation tools, this one requires nothing more than the URL of the
page you wish to transform and a tag. Once the service discovers items
for the feed, it is up to you to weed out the unnecessary ones, by
setting the minimum and maximum number of characters in a title and by
selecting the first and last news items of value. You can try FeedYES
for 14 days for free. You will get access to the full service. If you
like what you see, you can sign up for FeedYes premium, which will let
you create as many feeds as you like. With FeedYES premium, your feed
does not show any advertisments. Great for beginners!</p>
<p><strong>Good For: </strong>Great for Beginners!<br />
<strong>Views:</strong> You can try FeedYES for only 14 days for free.
You will get access to the full service. Feed Show advertisements in
free account. FeedYES premium cost US$29,95 for one year. Feeds for
premium users do not show any source or commercial message, just the
feed itself.</p>

<p><strong>6. <a target="_blank"
	href="http://www.ponyfish.com/">Ponyfish</a></strong> - I found Ponyfish to be
perhaps the easiest to use. After users provide the URL, the service
provides a small window of that address, where users must simply click
on each link that is to be added to the feed. After this Ponyfish tries
to determine a generic URL with your help (using "*" as wildcard
symbols), in order to retrieve future items to be added to the feed
automatically.</p>

<p><strong>7. <a target="_blank"
	href="http://www.page2rss.com/">Page2RSS</a></strong> - Described as "a service
that helps you monitor web sites that do not publish RSS feeds. It will
check any web page for updates and deliver them to your favorite RSS
aggregator." This site offers a bookmark toolbar button that provides a
quick way to generate a feed while visiting any website.</p>

<p>Hopefully, one of these tools can help you create a customized
RSS feed that suits your needs.</p>
