<h4>100% free T-PDF Password Remover</h4>

<p>Do you have a PDF (Adobe Acrobat) file which cannot be read,
	without providing the password security. T-PDF Password Remover is the
	solution for that. Using T-PDF Password Remover you can remove the
	password from PDF files. This is not a tool to crack the password of
	PDF files. Unless you know the password it is not possible to remove
	the password from PDF files. But after removing the password the PDF
	file won't prompt you to provide password each and everytime you open
	the PDF.

	restrictions in a few seconds. This program supports 40-bits/128-bits
	RC4 and 128-bits AES encryption.</p>
