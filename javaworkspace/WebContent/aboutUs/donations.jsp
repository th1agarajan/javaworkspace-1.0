<p>If you like this Java Workspace site and want to help support us,
please consider donating to help fund our web hosting costs. Donate button
at the top direct you to our secure PayPal account where you can donate an
amount you choose to help us offset our hosting costs.</p>


<p>All content on www.javaworkspace.com is free of charge for
personal or commercial use. No payment is required. However, there are
real costs associated with developing, maintaining, and hosting the
site. In addition, many hours are spent writing code, answering
questions, and adding requested features. Since the site is developed
and maintained by a single person I rely on donations to offset the time
and expenses associated with the site.</p>
